## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of sales recorded during the Diwali season to uncover meaningful insights about customer purchasing behavior. The analysis was performed using Python and Jupyter Notebook, leveraging libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to manipulate, visualize, and interpret the data.

## Objectives
The key objectives of this analysis were:

### Gender-Based Purchasing Trends
- Identifying which gender purchased more products.

### Revenue by State
- Determining which state generated the highest revenue during the Diwali season.

### Job Category Analysis
- Analyzing which job category had the highest number of purchases.

### Product Category Analysis
- Understanding the types of products (e.g., food, electronics) that were most popular among customers.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Libraries**:
  - **Numpy**: Numerical operations
  - **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
  - **Matplotlib**: Data visualization
  - **Seaborn**: Enhanced data visualization

## Methodology
### Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Removed missing or duplicate entries.
- Standardized column names and data formats.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized gender distribution and purchase trends.
- Aggregated revenue data by state.
- Grouped purchases by job category.
- Categorized products to identify the most purchased types.

### Insights Extraction
- Generated visualizations and summaries to uncover trends and patterns.

## Key Insights
